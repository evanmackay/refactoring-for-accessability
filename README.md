## Overview

I had to revise a website's code to meet accessibility standards. I did this by making sure semantic elements were present, inserting numbers into the headers to ensure that the website's code followed a sequential order, adding alternative attributes to all images, and adding a descriptive title element. Additionally, I added a hovering style to the links in the unordered list to identify them as links more easily.

### Elements Used For Accessibility
I used navs, headers, footers, and alt texts for images to make the website meet accessibility standards for search engine optimization.
