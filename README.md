The project I had was to revise a website's code to meet accessibility standards. I did this by making sure semantic elements were present, inserting numbers into the headers to ensure that the webiste's code followed a sequential order, adding alternative attributes to all images, and I adding a decsriptive title element. Additionaly, I added a hovering style to the links in the unordered list to identify them as links more easily.
