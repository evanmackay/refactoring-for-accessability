# refactoring-for-accessability

The project we had was to revise a websites code to meet accessibility standards. I did this by making sure semantic elements were present, inserting numbers in to the headers to ensure that the webiste followed a sequential order, adding alternative attributes to all images, and adding a decsriptive title element. Additionaly, I added a hovering style to the links in the unordered list.
